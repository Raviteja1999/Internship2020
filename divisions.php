                    <h3 style="text-align: left; "><span style="color:#b22222;">DIVISION OF CROP IMPROVEMENT</span></h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The Division of Crop Improvement takes the responsibility of the crop improvement research needs of all types of tobacco grown in India. The Division comprises two disciplines, Plant Genetics and Breeding and Biotechnology. The scientists of the Division employ conventional breeding with biotechnology methods for the improvement of Indian tobacco cultivars in terms of productivity, physical & chemical quality, trade preference, resistance to biotic & abiotic stresses, reducing harmful substances like nicotine, tar, carbon monoxide, tobacco specific nitrosamines (TSNA), etc. The materials developed by the Division form the basic material for carrying out research by other disciplines. Also, germplasm maintenance and enhancement, cytogenetical, genetical and molecular studies on tobacco are the important basic and strategic areas of research undertaken at the division. Production and distribution of quality seed to farmers is another key responsibility of the Division. In addition, the Division assists in the smooth functioning of the All India Network Research Project on Tobacco (AINPT) in general and crop improvement in particular. </p>

                    <p>
                This Division have so far instrumental in developing 98 varieties in all types of tobacco for cultivation throughout the country. All the ruling FCV tobacco varieties cultivated in India viz., Hema, VT-1158, Siri, N-98 and CTRI Sulakhana in black soils and southern light soils of Andhra Pradesh; Kanchan in Northern light soils of A.P; Kanchan, Rathna and FCH-222 in Karnataka light soils are released by the Division. Chewing varieties viz., Lichchavi, Pusa Tobacco-76, Bhagyalakshmi, Meenakshi, Meenakshi (CR), Abirami, Kaviri and Manasi; Rustica varieties viz., DD-437, Darla and Torsa; Burley variety, Banket A-1; Cheroot varieties viz., Natu Special, Bhairavi and Lanka Special are some of the prominent non-FCV tobacco varieties released. Tobacco Mosaic Virus resistant varieties like VT-1158, Godavari Special and Banket A-1; Black-shank resistant varieties like CM-12(KA), Kanchan and Bhavya; Powdery Mildew resistant variety Swarna and caterpillar resistant chewing variety, Meenakshi CR etc. are few of the resistant cultivars released by the Division. Lines resistant to tobacco caterpillar (Spodoptera litura), tobacco aphid (Myzus nicotianae), Budworm (Helicoverpa armigera) and root-knot nematodes were also developed through interspecific hybridization and biotechnological approaches. In view of the health problems associated with tobacco, a number of improved lines having lower levels of harmful substances (Tar and TSNA - Tobacco Specific Nitrosamines) have been developed. A low tar yielding FCV variety, LT- Kanchan was released for NLS area. Also, hybrids having high yield potential along with desirable leaf quality viz. FCV hybrid, CH-1 for NLS and CH-3 for KLS, chewing tobacco hybrid, Kamatchi were released for the benefit of the farming community. Due to the concerted efforts of the scientists, the yield potential of FCV varieties has increased from 1,500 to 3,300 kg/ha while in non-FCV varieties, the yield increased from 2,000 to 4,000 kg/ha. Beside the yield, cured leaf quality was also substantially improved with the release of new varieties. Efforts are on to breed tobacco varieties suitable for extraction of edible oil besides higher levels of phyto-chemicals viz., solanesol, nicotine, protein etc.</p> 
                <p>
                This Division is instrumental in producing and distributing the pure seed of cultivated tobacco varieties to farmers for raising uniform healthy crop. In any given season, more than 90% of the tobacco crop area is planted with the tobacco seed supplied by ICAR-CTRI and its Regional Stations. The service rendered by the Institute, to the farming community in seed production aspects is paying richer dividends in terms of increased leaf quality, higher leaf yields and greater monetary returns to the growers.</p>
                <p>
                As a National Active Germplasm Site, ICAR-CTRI is giving top priority for the tobacco germplasm management. At present more than 3,300 germplasm accessions belonging to N. tabacum L and N. rustica L besides 60 wild Nicotiana species, are maintained in the Institute gene bank. Germplasm collection, maintenance, evaluation, documentation and utilization are taken up on regular basis. Germplasm accessions with desirable agronomic and quality traits and resistance to various diseases and insect pests are identified and are being exploited in varietal improvement programmes.</p>

                    <strong><span style="color:#b22222;">DIVISION OF CROP PRODUCTION</span></strong></p>
                    
                <p>
                    Development of appropriate agro-techniques to enhance the productivity of tobacco and tobacco based cropping systems on a sustainable basis. Suitable Good Agricultural practices (GAPs) were translated to the farming community of different tobacco domains by developing new concepts and approaches for sustainable tobacco production. Technologies were developed and translated to the farming community on water use efficient micro-irrigation systems for nursery production, poly tray seedling production, integrated nutrient management, organic farming, integrated farming systems, region specific fertilizer recommendation, watershed management for SLS,  Drip fertigation for irrigated Alfisols, integrated weed management and alternative uses of tobacco. Since, flue curing costs about 30% of cost of production in FCV tobacco production, technologies for fuel saving viz. low profile barn, insulation with thermocole or rock-wool or straw-mit, redesigning the arrangement of barn flue pipes, modification of the  barn furnace for fuel saving and reducing the cost of curing by use of  alternative fuels to wood and coal were developed. Research work is under progress for integrated weed management including Orobanche, strategies to mitigate false ripening, climate resilient technologies etc., Since, tobacco is a high value cash crop; only cropping systems rather than a single crop can be next best viable alternative option to tobacco hence, Cropping systems/ crops for different agro-ecological sub-regions have been developed and recommended.</P>

                    The division conducts research on the incidence and crop losses caused by insect pests and pathogens, etiology and epidemiology of diseases, bio-ecology of insect pests and developing integrated management schedules against insect pests and pathogens. The mandate of the division is to conduct basic and applied research on insect pests and disease management in tobacco and tobacco based cropping systems for development, demonstration and popularization of sustainable crop protection technologies. In order to manage the insect pest and diseases, scientists at the institute and its research station have developed several promising crop protection technologies. The work done on neem and neem based products in controlling insect pests note worthy. The entomologists have standardized mass production of bio-control agents particularly NPV. IPM modules with cultural, biological and need - based application of selective insecticides have been developed and successfully demonstrated in Farmers&rsquo; fields which helped in production of pesticide residue free tobacco for export.</p>

                <p>
                    Tobacco is an important commercial crop cultivated in 0.45 million ha producing annually 800 million kg of leaf.  Pure seed place a vital role in obtaining uniform crop growth which inturn ensures higher yields and superior leaf quality in tobacco. In order to provide quality seed to tobacco farmers, ICAR-CTRI, Rajahmundry started producing and distributing the pure seed of released tobacco varieties to the farmers since 1952.  Further, Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), New Delhi has sanctioned a Revolving Fund Scheme (RF Scheme) in the year 1990 with the objective of supplying pure seed and healthy seedlings of released tobacco varieties to growers for improving the yield and quality of Flue-Cured-Virginia (FCV) tobacco. Under the Scheme, annually about 8,000 kg of FCV tobacco seed and 100 kg of Lanka tobacco seed (Non-FCV) are produced and distributed to the tobacco growers in Andhra Pradesh. Quality seeds of released varieties are produced following the standard seed production practices at Institute farm or at selected farmer fields. The pure seed confirming to the seed standards are distributes to tobacco growers with ICAR-CTRI security Hologram fixed on the sachets in order to make them tamper proof. </p>

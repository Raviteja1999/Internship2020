			Smt. Suma Kumar M.S. planted oil palm in an area of 0.56 hectare 
			during June, 1996 and the plantation is of 15 years old now. During 
			the juvenile period, the farmer cultivated banana as intercrop 
			during the first and second year of planting oil palm. She adopted 
			controlled irrigation at weekly intervals. A special practice 
			undertaken by the farmer is that the trenches were made across the 
			slope in the garden for draining the excess water during monsoon 
			season and the conservation of available moisture during the long 
			dry period experienced in the region and irrigation canals are 
			closed for maintenance. Another soil moisture conservation</span></font><img border="0" src="Images/Successimage2.JPG" width="139" height="137" align="right"><font color="#FFFFCC"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif"> 
			measure was undertaken by providing the palm basin with mulching 
			utilizing the cut fronds obtained during oil palm harvesting. 
			Fertilizers were applied to the oil palm crop in six split doses, 
			thus, maximizing the fertilizer use efficiency. In addition, she 
			applied poultry manure mixed with neem cake available locally at low 
			cost. It is to be noted that the poultry manure is kept for 2-3 
			months for decomposition in the trenches available throughout the 
			field along with trash and cut leaves and well decomposed material 
			was applied in palm basins. Care was taken to apply the manures and 
			fertilizers within the area of 3 metres radius in basin. In 
			addition, tank slit was applied, once in five years, to the garden 
			to improve the soil physical conditions. Fresh fruit bunches 
			harvesting was done with pole at weekly intervals. Average height of 
			the palm is around 8.00 metres. The crop gives an excellent look 
			with all spindles opened and no deficiency or disorder is observed 
			anywhere in the field.</span></font></p>
